Back to my own solutions. No LLMs this year.

## 2024 - 26/50⭐
This year, I'm learning LLMs, and will use them to solve the daily tasks.
I won't copy/paste full problems into LLM, but trying to learn how to best write good prompts

Day 1 starts with Continue.dev plugin in IntelliJ with these LLMs
* Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet - Chat
* Qwen2.5-Coder 7B locally via Ollama - Autocomplete

From day 3 and forward, I will add each response from the LLM chat as a commit, and the prompt I made as the commit message
If I make something myself, I will prepend the commit with Johannes:
